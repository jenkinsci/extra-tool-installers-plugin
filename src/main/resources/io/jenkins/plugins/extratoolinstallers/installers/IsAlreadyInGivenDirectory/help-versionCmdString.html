    The command to run to check what version is installed.
    The command to be run must be the first line.
    Any arguments must be on the following lines.
    </p>

    <p>
    This command does not have to be the executable file that we specified in the "Executable Path" field, but it will usually be the same, typically with an argument asking the command to report its version.
    </p>

    <p>
    e.g. for allure, if executable is located at <code>/opt/allure/bin/allure</code> the value to enter here would be:
    <blockquote>
        <code>
            /opt/allure/bin/allure<br>
            --version
        </code>
    </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
    If this is left blank (the default) then no version check will be performed.
    </p>
