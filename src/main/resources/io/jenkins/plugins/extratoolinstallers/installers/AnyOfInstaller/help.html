  <p>
    Attempts one or more installation methods in sequence, retrying if appropriate, until one method succeeds.
    The installation will be declared an overall success once a method succeeds.
  </p>
  <p>
    During an installation, any non-applicable installers
    (e.g. labels not matching)
    will be silently ignored.
    The remainder will be reported on, including any retries.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the event of a total failure
    (after all applicable installers and all retries have been attempted),
    the last failure failure exception will be fully logged and the build will fail.
  </p>
  <p>
    e.g.
    Specifying two nearly-identical Zip Extraction installers,
    both downloading the same .zip file but from two different webservers,
    will allow builds to continue if the first webserver is down/inaccessible etc.
