<p>
A list of one or more installation methods to be attempted in sequence.
This installer will declare its installation an overall success if any of the methods succeed.
</p>
<p>
The order of installers in the list is the order in which they will be attempted.
During an installation, any non-applicable installers (e.g. labels not matching) will be silently ignored.
The remainder will be reported on, including any retries.
</p>
<p>
In the event of a total failure (after all installers and all retries), the last failure exception will be fully logged and the build will fail.
