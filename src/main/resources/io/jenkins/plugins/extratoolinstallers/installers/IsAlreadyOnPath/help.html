    Locates an executable that's already on the PATH and sets the tool home relative to that.
    Fails if the executable is not already on the PATH.
  </p>
    Optionally runs a command with arguments to determine the version,
    parses the command output,
    and
    verifies that the reported version is in the specified range.

    Note: This does not install anything.
    It's purpose is to allow nodes to avoid installing things they already have, or to fail builds before they run on a node lacking a needed tool.
    If combined with the &quot;Any of...&quot; installer, the &quot;fail&quot; can trigger a real installation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example,
    if the
    executable name
    is &quot;foo&quot;, the
    relative path
    is &quot;../bar&quot; and the executable can be found in the
    PATH
    at &quot;/usr/local/bin/foopackage/bin/foo&quot;,
    then Jenkins will be told that the tool's HOME directory is &quot;/usr/local/bin/foopackage/bar&quot;
    (as that is /usr/local/bin/foopackage/bin/../bar).
    If &quot;foo&quot; is not on the PATH then the installation method will fail.
