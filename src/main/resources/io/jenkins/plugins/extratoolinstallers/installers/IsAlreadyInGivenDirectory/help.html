    Locates an executable in the given path and sets the tool home relative to that.
    Fails if the given path is not an executable file.
  </p>
    Optionally runs a command with arguments to determine the version,
    parses the command output,
    and
    verifies that the reported version is in the specified range.

    Note: This does not install anything.
    It's purpose is to allow nodes to avoid installing things they already have, or to fail builds before they run on a node lacking a needed tool.
    If combined with the &quot;Any of...&quot; installer, the &quot;fail&quot; can trigger a real installation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example,
    if the
    executable path
    is &quot;/opt/foo/usr/bin/bar&quot;, the
    relative path
    is &quot;../..&quot;,
    then Jenkins will be told that the tool's HOME directory is &quot;/opt/foo&quot;
    If file &quot;/opt/foo/usr/bin/bar&quot; doesn't exist, then the installation method will fail.
