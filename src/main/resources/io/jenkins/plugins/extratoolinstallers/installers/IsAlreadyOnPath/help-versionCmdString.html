    The command to run to check what version is installed.
    The command to be run must be the first line.
    Any arguments must be on the following lines.
    </p>

    <p>
    This does not have to be the same command that we looked for on the path, but it will usually be the same, typically with an argument asking the command to report its version.
    </p>

    <p>
    e.g. for git, the command would be &quot;<code>git --version</code>&quot; and so the value to enter here would be:
    <blockquote>
        <code>
            git<br>
            --version
        </code>
    </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
    If this is left blank (the default) then no version check will be performed.
    </p>
