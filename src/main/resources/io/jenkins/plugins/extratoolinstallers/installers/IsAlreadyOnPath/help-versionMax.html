    The maximum acceptable version.
    </p>

    <p>
    Comparisons split on period characters and do numerical comparison ahead of lexicographical.
    e.g. <code>1.10</code> is later than <code>1.2</code> and <code>10a</code> is later than <code>10</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    e.g. for git, you could specify
    &quot;<code>2.99</code>&quot;
    and the version check will reject a version of git of 3.anything or later, or even 2.99.1, but would also reject 2.100.
    </p>

    <p>
    If this is left blank (the default) then there is no maximum, but the minimum (if any) can still apply.
    If neither minimum or maximum is set then no version check will be performed.
    </p>
