    The minimum acceptable version.
    </p>

    <p>
    Comparisons split on period characters and do numerical comparison ahead of lexicographical.
    e.g. <code>1.10</code> is later than <code>1.2</code> and <code>10a</code> is later than <code>10</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    e.g. for git, you could specify
    &quot;<code>2.16</code>&quot;
    and the version check will reject a version of git of 2.15 or earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
    If this is left blank (the default) then there is no minimum, but the maximum (if any) can still apply.
    If neither minimum or maximum is set then no version check will be performed.
    </p>
